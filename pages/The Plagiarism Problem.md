access to the Internet and that computers allow us to <strong>copy-paste</strong> effortlessly.
Plagiarism has become more and more of a problem recently.</p>

<p>In many cases, students do not even know what is meant by "plagiarism".
Then they are surprised when they are caught doing it and told that the
penalty is <strong>dismissal</strong>.</p>
<p>Ngee Ann Polytechnic uses <strong>TurnitinÂ®</strong> (a text-based similarity-check
software) to help stop the spread of plagiarism.</p>
<p>Turnitin has a huge database of WWW materials, e-journals and student
submissions. With Turnitin, lecturers have an easy-to-use tool that helps
to detect cases where students have copied from the Internet or from their
friends.</p>
<p>However, an important aspect of using Turnitin is that it presents a <strong>learning opportunity</strong>...</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>students need to learn what plagiarism is and what it means to produce
original work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that by doing their own work, students learn more and take more responsibility
for their own learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the value of the Ngee Ann diploma is enhanced if anti-plagiarism
measures are taken seriously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that all work in the Poly should either be original, or properly cited
if it is quoted or paraphrased.</p>
</li>
</ul>
